# Synapse ID Miner

A Python package for mining Synapse IDs from scientific articles in Europe PMC's Open Access subset.

## Features

- Downloads and processes XML files from Europe PMC's Open Access subset
- Extracts Synapse IDs with surrounding context from articles
- Handles large XML files efficiently using parallel processing
- Saves results incrementally to prevent data loss
- Provides progress tracking during download and processing
- Supports starting from a specific file and limiting the number of files processed

## Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/nf-osi/synapse-miner.git

```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

Process XML files from Europe PMC's Open Access subset:

```bash
synapse-miner http -u https://europepmc.org/ftp/oa/ -o results.csv -s PMC3000001_PMC3010000.xml.gz -m 1
```

Arguments:
- `-u, --url`: Base URL of the Europe PMC Open Access subset
- `-o, --output`: Path to save results
- `-s, --start-from`: Filename to start processing from (optional)
- `-m, --max-files`: Maximum number of files to process (optional)

### Python API

```python
from synapse_miner import SynapseMiner

# Initialize miner
miner = SynapseMiner()

# Process files from HTTP server
miner.process_http_files(
    base_url="https://europepmc.org/ftp/oa/",
    output_path="results.csv",
    start_from="PMC3000001_PMC3010000.xml.gz",
    max_files=1
)
```

## Output

The package generates two types of output files:

1. Main results file (`results.csv`): Contains all findings across all processed files
2. Batch files (`results.csv.{filename}.csv`): Contains findings from individual files

Each row in the output contains:
- `pmcid`: The PubMed Central ID of the article
- `synid`: The Synapse ID found in the article
- `context`: 25 characters before and after the Synapse ID for context

## Notes

- The package automatically handles retries for failed downloads
- Downloaded files are cleaned up after processing to save disk space
- Progress is tracked and displayed during both download and processing
- Results are saved after each file is processed to prevent data loss
